<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]][repo-url]

This project is made to cheat at the [Aim Trainer on HumanBenchmark.com][trainer-hb] using Windows' Win32 API for moving the mouse and clicking the targets. It's not extremely fast or anything, moreso just a way to expand my experience with C# and figure out how to use external libraries for my own projects.

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `JMVRy`, `AimTrainer-HB`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

### Built With

* [![C#][CSharp]][CSharp-url]
* [ScreenCapture.NET][ScreenCapture.NET]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

To run the program on your own machine, follow the following steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
This is a list on all the things you need, in order to run the software on your own machine
* Windows 7/8/10/11/Above
  Any Windows version should work, but I'd suggest 7 or above, because I can't be certain if any version below 7 will work.
* Visual Studio 2022
  Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com and download Visual Studio 2022
* NuGet
  Visual Studio 2022 comes pre-installed with NuGet, but if you're using something else like VSCode, then Google or DuckDuckGo is your best friend.
* ScreenCapture.NET
  This project utilizes a NuGet package called ScreenCapture.NET by DarthAffe, which can also be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/DarthAffe/ScreenCapture.NET) or at [this NuGet package][ScreenCapture.NET].
* ScreenCapture.NET.DX11
  This project also currently utilizes ScreenCapture.NET.DX11, which is a DirectX 11 specific way of capturing a screenshot, found at [this NuGet package][ScreenCapture.NET.DX11] or [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/DarthAffe/ScreenCapture.NET).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JMVRy/AimTrainer-HB.git
   ```
1. Install NuGet packages
   ```
   In Visual Studio, go to Project>Manage NuGet packages... and install ScreenCapture.NET.DX11
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   NuGet\Install-Package ScreenCapture.NET.DX11
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   dotnet add package ScreenCapture.NET.DX11
   ```
1. Change the Platform target
   ```
   In Visual Studio, go to Project>[Your project name] Properties and change "Platform target" to x64. I am unsure if x86 is supported.
   ```
1. Change any pixel locations that are different for your own machine
   Because this project was made for my own machine and the exact locations and sizes of my monitors, it may not work as well for your own computer. As long as you are using Firefox, have the Bookmark Toolbar shown, keep the screen Maximized but not Fullscreen, use a 1080p monitor (as well as making sure that this is the last monitor if you use multiple), possibly even have the toolbar hidden, have the Windows Night Light turned off (turns the screen more orange/red), and keep the webpage at 100% zoom, then it should work fine.
   If your system does not support DirectX 11, then I suggest trying [ScreenCapture.NET.X11](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScreenCapture.NET.X11) or [ScreenCapture.NET.DX9](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScreenCapture.NET.DX9), then changing any code mentioning "DX11" to whichever you've chosen.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is primarily made for the [Aim Trainer on HumanBenchmark][trainer-hb], as well as being specific to my own monitor setup. If you've followed the Installation setup and there's no more problems, then it should just be plug-and-play. Build and run, and any pixel with that specific shade of blue (`#95c3e8`) will be clicked, as long as it's within the 1000x400 box that contains the targets.

_For more examples, please refer to the [TODO: Documentation](https://example.com)_
